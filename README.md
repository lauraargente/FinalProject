# FinalProject
 This is the final project from the CEI's Website Design course.
 You can navigate to this address to visit my portfolio: https://lauraargente.github.io/FinalProject/
 The final project consists of my personal portfolio which consists of different sections: 
- Home page 
- About
- Recent Work (we will find a gallery with the personal projects I've been working on most recently)
- Contact
- Recent Work section 
During the creative part I was inspired by designs from landingfolio.com and awards.com. Then, using the Figma design program, I developed the wireframes and designed the portfolio and its different sections from scratch. The web logo has been designed and customized as well.
